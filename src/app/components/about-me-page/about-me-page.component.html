        My name is Gabriel, I'm 20 years old, and a software engineering student at Centennial College. Nice to meet you!<br><br>

        I started browsing the internet since I was very young, but I properly started my journey in the software/hardware world when I was about 8 years old and got my
        first laptop. At first, I was mostly interested in playing games (something I still do passionately to this day), but after some time I also discovered the art of
        graphical design and video editing through YouTube, which became a huge part of what I would do for the next couple of years. I taught myself how to edit images using
        Photoshop, post-processing on After Effects, editing on Sony Vegas, animation on Flash, and 3D modeling on Cinema 4D.<br><br>

        As I got older and more mature (around 13 years old), my parents gave me with my first proper desktop computer. This enabled me to not only <s>further fuel my gaming
        addiction</s> expand my graphical design skills, but it also got me started into the more technical side of videogames and computers as well. I learned how to make game
        servers, how to write simple scripting programs, what were JSON files, and how to make simple web pages using HTML and CSS.<br><br>

        As high school started, I dug deeper into the topic of coding, and made sure to take optional courses related to programming and hardware at my school. One thing lead
         to another, and as my secondary education came to a closing, I started learning Python and Java by myself. Currently, I find myself studying both the backend and
         frontend technologies in college. Even though I find both programming paths very enjoyable, the skillset I've acquired throughout the years certainly makes the client
         side part of the process more fun, since it's a mix between graphical design and coding.<br><br>
